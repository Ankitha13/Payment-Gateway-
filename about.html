  <h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>This is an Indian non-profit and non-governmental organization
		   that provides care and protection to the homeless and those in need.
		   We provide residential care and healthcare support. In 1997 online
		   giving was a novelty. Few companies existed to help non-profits raise
		   money online.We set out to change that by creating a company 
		   founded on the desire to blend a business opportunity with a chance to 
		   do some good. We endeavour to act according to the following principles.
		   Peace,Life and Love Delight the Customer Honesty and Openness.</p>
